# 🏔️ NordOS (Fjäll) 
> **A Straightforward, High-Performance Linux Desktop.**

NordOS is a custom-engineered Linux distribution built on an **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** foundation. It is designed for those who demand the raw performance of the **System76 kernel** and the aesthetic precision of the **Nord** palette, delivered in a "ready-to-work" KDE Plasma environment.

## ❄️ The Philosophy
NordOS follows the "Straightforward" logic: **Performance should be default, and beauty should be native.** We’ve performed "LFS-lite" surgery on the Ubuntu base—stripping away GNOME and standard generic kernels to make room for a Swedish-inspired minimalist workstation.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Features
* **Engine:** Powered by the **System76 Kernel** and **System76 Scheduler** for superior CPU prioritization and low-latency desktop responsiveness.
* **Graphics:** **NVIDIA-Native**. The latest proprietary drivers (550+) are baked into the ISO. No "Software & Updates" clicking required—it works from the Live Boot.
* **Desktop:** A redesigned **KDE Plasma** experience. We took the technical excellence of the **Breeze** engine and repainted it entirely with the **Nord** ($#2E3440$) color palette.
* **Identity:** Inspired by the rolling Swedish **fjälls**, the UI is airy, grounded, and focused on a traditional workflow layout that is familiar to Zorin and Windows users.
